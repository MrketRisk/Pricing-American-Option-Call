This is an example of pricing American Call option using Monte Carlo simulation.
Monte Carlo Simulation has distinct advantages as it is suited for path dependent derivatives or in cases where there can be multiple stochastic variables.
In this example, the Least Squares Method developed by Longstaff and Schwartz has been utilized.
For more, kindly refer the paper "Valuing American Options by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares Approach" by Francis A. Longstaff and Eduardo S. Schwartz.
Kindly check the American Option.ipynb for the Python Code. I have created a function to calculate the American Option Price. Also, there is detailed procedure written as comments. As a bonus, GBM of stock prices has also been created in the same function which has a variety of applications.
